    <div class="bgd">I am a freelancer, Yes i work from home, Yes i work hard to make money but some people unnecessary ask for extra work , some people ask for free courses , some people ask for free stuffs.I am a freelancer but this does not mean i will work for free. I have bills just like you. I pay hefty rent , I pay for internet , I pay for themes . plugins , design modules and hosting fee .I also pay my helping hands who help me in getting jobs done on time.Still some people think freelance means free work. They ignore the fact that we (the freelancers ) makes our living hood by doing hard work over 16 hours a day. Each project either it is small or big .</div>
